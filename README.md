Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is how easy it is to keep track of the different changes that my team members and I make to different files over time.

What I find most frustrating about version control is how I manually have to solve merge conflicts, as there is no way to directly override a previous version to replace it with my updates.
